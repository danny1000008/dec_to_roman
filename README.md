# dec_to_roman
A Python web application. Type in a base 10 number, and it will be converted to roman numerals, or vice versa. Also, if you choose a number in [1888, current_year], it will show some randomly selected movie and actor information by querying a database (the data came from imdb.com).

# Motivation
This project started out as a project on FreeCodeCamp. I wanted to work on my database skills, so once I had the converter working, I added a small database of movies and actors from imdb.com.
